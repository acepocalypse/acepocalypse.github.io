  <p>
    Born and raised in Indonesia, I am a passionate data analyst and software engineer with a strong foundation in Python programming. I am currently pursuing a degree in Business Analytics at Purdue University, where I am honing my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and software development. In my free time, you can find me either swimming, biking, running, or watching movies.
